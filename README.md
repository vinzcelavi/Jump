# Front-end test üöÄ

This is the result of a front-end test I did for a job application at [Jump](https://www.join-jump.com/).

## Stack

-   Next.js
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Vaul
-   React Hook Form
-   React Query
-   Zod

## Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm i
# or
bun i
```

## Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

## Features

-   Pure CSS animations for the main loader (transformed with Tailwind CSS).
-   React Query to fetch and cache the Pok√©mon data from [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/).
-   Custom input field for the filter field.
-   Select for the type filter.
-   React-hook-form for the form.
-   Zod for form validation.
-   Next.js API routes to handle form submissions.
-   Open a drawer for pokemon details and bigger image.
-   Responsive compliancy.

## Time distribution (roughly speaking)

-   30min: Setup the project, add global styles and install dependencies.
-   1h: Add the first page (list of pok√©mon) and components (search input, select, pokemon card).
-   1h: Add the form for adding a new pok√©mon.
-   1h: Add the drawer for pokemon details.
-   30min: Review and small improvements.

## Known issues

-   Email field auto-complete background color (white on dark mode).

## Possible improvements

-   Add a loading state for the search input.
-   Add a error state for the search input.
-   Improve the a11y of the application.
