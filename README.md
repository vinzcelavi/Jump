# Front-end test üöÄ

This is the result of a front-end test I did for a job application at [Jump](https://www.join-jump.com/).

## Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm i
# or
bun i
```

## Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.
